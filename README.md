# feature-analysis
Example of using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), applying a CNN to an image, progressing through the convolution layer, activation layer and pooling layer operations to extract the inside feature, in this case an edge feature.  The following notebook is a demonstration of the prototype feature detection workflow applied to satellite imagery.
